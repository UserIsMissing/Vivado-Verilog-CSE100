# Vivado-Verilog-CSE100
For job applications - Here is my coursework using VHDL/Verilog

For Job Applications - Portfolio of Digital Logic Design Work

This repository showcases my coursework from UCSC's CSE-100 (Logic Design) class, where I developed a solid foundation in digital logic design using Verilog and Vivado. The course covered essential topics in Boolean algebra, logic minimization, finite-state machine design, and sequential circuits, along with in-depth exploration of programmable logic devices and system-level design.

Skills and Technologies Gained:

Verilog HDL for circuit modeling and simulation, building from basic gates to complex sequential circuits.
Vivado for synthesizing, testing, and deploying designs on FPGA platforms, with hands-on labs that reinforced real-world hardware programming.
Understanding of electrical circuit behavior concepts, including propagation delay, three-state outputs, fanout, and logic levels.
This repository contains my laboratory assignments and projects that demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and debug digital circuits in Verilog and deploy them using Vivado.
